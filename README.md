# 👋 Hi there!

## I'm Alexis López — Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Enthusiast | Data Science Explorer

🚀 Passionate about building scalable applications and empowering decisions with data.

I’m a full-stack developer with **3+ years of experience** crafting web solutions using **Node.js, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL**. I also have **2+ years of experience** with **NestJS, Linux server administration, and CI/CD pipelines**, which allows me to handle both development and deployment with confidence.

I enjoy solving complex problems with clean architecture and solid principles. Currently, I’m diving deeper into **Data Science**, learning how to transform data into actionable insights — because I believe great software isn't just about code, but also about making smart decisions.
