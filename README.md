### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Hi everyone, it's me, Alexis LÃ³pez. I'm a full-stack developer. I have 3 years of experience working with Node.js, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and 2 years of experience with NestJS, Linux, deployments like CI/CD, and server administration services such as Nginx, PostgreSQL, Samba, maintaining firewalls. I'm also studying Data Science because I find it very interesting how companies can make decisions based on data##

SEE YOU NEXT DEVELOPERS!
